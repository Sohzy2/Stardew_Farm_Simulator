This folder is supposed to store all the images of crops / map tiles and whatever.
However, Stardew Valley Maps are in XNB format, and unpacked into tbin format, so I'm still doing research into how to extract them

For extraction purposes, refer to https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1709011717
I'm using the XNB Mod Toolkit.
